# Houdini batch export textures and OBJs

## Tool Summary

This script batch exports multiple 3D meshes and their corresponding 
textures maps into a well organised folder structure with the specified
naming convention. This works in combination with the UE5 tool to map 
textures to 3D meshes. 

## Note

This tool was solely written for specific uses within a personal project 
and is nowhere near a finished piece of work. The aim was to produce a 
quick script to automate a repetitive task. It is not designed to be 
robust nor is it ready to be integrated into other people's workflows, 
unless further changes are made in the code. In the future, I will add 
error checking and testing to make it more reliable, and also potentially 
a UI to make it artist friendly. But the main logic is there :)

## I will add more details soon
